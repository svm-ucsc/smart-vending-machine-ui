# smart-vending-machine
  Repository for the code dedicated to the management of the Smart Vending Machine project for CSE123A/B at UCSC for the Winter/Spring 2022 quarters.

# getting-started-with-UI
## Step 1:
  Install Node v16.13.2 to your computer (use homebrew or install from website). Confirm version by running: 'node --version'
## Step 2:
  Install npm v8.1.2 to your computer. Confirm by running: 'npm --version'
## Step 3:
  Run the command: 'npm install'
  This will install the bootstrap framework and other packages to your computer locally. These files will be in the .gitignore so that we are not constantly pushing ~20gb of the framework unneccesarily.

### Extras:
If you are using VS Code, I recommend installing the Vetur Extension.
