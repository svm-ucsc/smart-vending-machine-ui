## Step 1:
  Install Node v16.13.2 to your computer (use homebrew or install from website). Confirm version by running: 'node --version'.
## Step 2:
  Install npm v8.1.2 to your computer. Confirm by running: 'npm --version'.
## Step 3:
  Run the command: 'npm install bootstrap'
  This will install the bootstrap framework to your computer locally. These files will be in the .gitignore so that we are not constantly pushing ~20gb of the framework unneccesarily.
